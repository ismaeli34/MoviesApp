Project Title: Movie Management Application

Description:
The Movie Management Application is a full-stack web application built using Angular for the frontend and Java Spring Boot for the backend. The project is designed to provide users with a seamless platform to explore, manage, and interact with movie-related data.

The application enables users to view a complete list of movies, including detailed information such as the cast, directors, and images. Users can also perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage the movie database.

To ensure security and personalized access, the application includes authentication and authorization features with modules for user registration, login, and password recovery (forgot password).

Key Features:

Movie Management

Display list of movies with details (title, genre, cast, director, poster images).

Add new movies to the system.

Update movie details.

Delete movies from the list.

User Management

Secure user login and registration.

JWT-based authentication for secure API communication.

Forgot Password functionality with email-based reset option.

Frontend (Angular)

Responsive UI built with Angular and Bootstrap/Material Design.

Dynamic components for displaying movie details and user forms.

Client-side form validation for login, register, and movie forms.

Backend (Spring Boot + Java)

RESTful APIs to handle movie and user operations.

Integration with a relational database (MySQL).

Secure endpoints using Spring Security and JWT.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap/Angular Material

Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, Hibernate/JPA

Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL

Tools: Maven, Postman, Git/GitHub

Outcome:
This project demonstrates a practical implementation of a modern full-stack web application, integrating frontend and backend technologies. It provides both end-users and administrators with the ability to interact with a movie database in a secure and efficient way.
